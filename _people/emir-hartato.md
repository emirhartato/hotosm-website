<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">I have a passion for Geographic Information Science including its applications, mainly for environmental, development, and humanitarian issues. I have a wide array of expertise such as Geographic Information System (GIS), remote sensing, cartography & geovisualization, crowdsourcing/volunteered geographic information (including OpenStreetMap), and hazard/disaster management. I also have a strong background working with civil government, NGOs (local & international), and community in the various region to deliver the best solution for their needs. I have Geography degree from Universitas Indonesia & Masters of Geographic Information Science (MGIS) from Univerity of Canterbury New Zealand.

I was working for HOT full-time from 2011-2014 mostly in Indonesia. Now, I'm currently work for Planet Labs, Inc., however, I still spend some of my spare time to volunteer within HOT communities.
